## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Topics Covered in the week 5 Code file are as follows:
#Tidy Data
#Spreading and Gathering
#Separating and Uniting
#Missing Values
#Case Study on WHO data


#This tool helps in tidying up the messy datasets
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
#This package serves as a lightweight, cross-platform and easy to maintain
```{r}
library(tinytex)
```
#Sample Dataset 
```{r}
table1
```
#Second sample dataset
```{r}
table2
```
#To spread across two tibbles
#For Cases
```{r}
table4a
```
#For Population
```{r}
table4b
```
# This code is used to compute rate per 10,000
```{r}
table1 %>%
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```
# To compute cases per year
```{r}
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)
```
#To understand the Visual Changes install the necessary tool ggplot2
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
#Result will be a plot where we can notice the visual changes
```{r}
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))
```
#The gather() is used whenever we notice the columns are not variables
```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```
#Here, the variables are stored in cell values
```{r}
table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
```
#Below are the steps used to combine the tidied versions of both tibbles into a single tibble
#Step1
```{r}
tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```
#Step2
```{r}
tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
```
#Step3
```{r}
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
```
#Each observation is spread across two rows
```{r}
table2 %>%
    spread(key = type, value = count)
```
#Separate() is used to separate out the column name as well as to separate into
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```
#Using a specific character to separate
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```
#To convert to better types
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)
```
#To separate last 2 digits of each year
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)
```
#Unite() is used to rejoin the multiple columns
```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year)
```
#USe "" to if we do not want any separator
```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
```
#Understanding the Missing Values
```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
```
#To make implicit missing value explicit
```{r}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return)
```
#To make explicit missing value implicit
```{r}
stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = TRUE)
```
#Another important tool to make missing values explicit
```{r}
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr)
```
#This is used for small tables of data
```{r}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)
```
#It is used where values are not repeated when they are recorded each time.
```{r}
treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```
#CaseStudy - WHO dataset taken
```{r}
who
```
#Use of na.rm to exclude the missing values and analyze on present values
```{r}
who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE)
who1
```
#Counting them to get the clue on structure
```{r}
who1 %>% 
  count(key)
```
#MAking all variable names consistent
```{r}
who2 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))
who2
```
#Using separate() to split the codes at each underscore
```{r}
who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
who3
```
#Dropping column to avoid redundancy
#One Column drop
```{r}
who3 %>% 
  count(new)
```
#Two Columns drop
```{r}
who4 <- who3 %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3)
who4
```
#Separating two columns by splitting afetr the first character
```{r}
who5 <- who4 %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who5
```
#At this stage, the WHO dataset is tidy now.
```{r}
who %>%
  gather(key, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
```
