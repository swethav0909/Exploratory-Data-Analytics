## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#Topics Covered in the week 6 Code file are as follows:
#Data TRansformation
#Filter, select, arrange functions 
#Use of adding new columns functions
#Grouped Summaries

#Package Requirements to use the data
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```
#Use for Tidy data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
#Get the data for flights
```{r}
flights
```
#Filter row data of flights by month and day selected and subset them
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
#To save the new result, use <-
```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
#To save and print at a time, put the code in one paranthesis
```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```
#Becareful to use double = sign or will get an error
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1)
```
#To find simple calculation like square root of a number
#Example 1:
```{r}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
```
#Example 2:
```{r}

1 / 49 * 49 == 1
```
#To find all flights that departed in November or December:
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```
#Alternativve code for similar result
```{r}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```
#Find flights that were not delayed by more than 2 hours
```{r}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
```
#Alternativve code for similar result
```{r}
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```
#Examples to work on Missing Values
```{r}
NA > 5
```
#Example 2
```{r}
10==NA
```
#Example 3
```{r}
NA + 10
```
#Example 4
```{r}
NA / 2
```
#Example 5: This one isa bit confusing
```{r}
NA==NA
```
#Let x be MY age. We don't know how old I am
```{r}
x <- NA
```
#Let y be Brother's age. We don't know how old he is.
```{r}
y <- NA
```
#To check are me and My brother the same age?
```{r}
x == y
```
#To find the value is missing or not
```{r}
is.na(x)
```
#When use of filter(), it will by default will not take missing values
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
```
```{r}
filter(df, x > 1)
```
#To preserve the missing values, need to ask explicitly
```{r}
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```
#Arrange() function works simialr to the filter() except for not selecting the rows
```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```
#To reorder by a column either in ascending or descending
```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```
#Below code sorts missing values at the end
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, x)
```
#In desecnding order
```{r}

arrange(df, desc(x))
```
#To select columns by name
```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```
#To select all columns between year and day
```{r}
select(flights, year:day)
```
#To select all columns except those from year to day
```{r}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```
#Rename is used to rename the variables but can be explicitly mention not to drop
```{r}
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```
#Another way to use select() is in conjunction with the everything()
```{r}
select(flights, time_hour, air_time, everything())
```
#To add new variables, use mutate() function
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time)
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

#To refer to the columns we created
```{r}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours)
```

#To only keep the new variables
```{r}
transmute(flights,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours)
```

#To use modular arithmetic within the code to break integers up into pieces
```{r}
transmute(flights,
  dep_time,
  hour = dep_time %/% 100,
  minute = dep_time %% 100)
```

#Lead allows you to refer to leading values
```{r}
(x <- 1:10)
```
```{r}
lead(x)
```
#Lag allows you to refer to lagging values
```{r}
lag(x)
```
#To find the cumulative sum
```{r}
x
```
```{r}
cumsum(x)
```
#To find the cumulative mean
```{r}
cummean(x)
```
#To rank the values in either order
```{r}
y <- c(1, 2, 2, NA, 3, 4)
min_rank(y)
min_rank(desc(y))
```
#USe of multiple variants for ranking
```{r}
row_number(y)
dense_rank(y)
percent_rank(y)
cume_dist(y)
```
##Summarise() collapses a data frame to a single row
```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#To group by a specific column(s) and see in summary
```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
##To combine multiple operations with the pipe
```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarise(by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```
#Install required packages
```{r}
install.packages("digest")
```
```{r}
library(digest)
```
# We can infer that delays increase with distance up to ~750 miles 
# Also decrease 
```{r}
ggplot(data = delay, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
##The below code is a bit complex as we need to give each intermediate data frame a name
#Even though we do not need it.
#For to solve this issue, we use pipe within the code
```{r}
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```
#Use code without using na.rm and we see a missing values
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```
#Use na.rm to exclude them
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
#Excluding the cancelled flights and then considering the non cancelled flights
```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```

#To see or count the number of planes that have highest average delayes
```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay)
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)
```
# To get a clear idea on what insight to take, 
#lets draw a scatterplot for number of flights versus average delay
```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```
#Install package lahman to convert tibble
```{r}
install.packages("Lahman")
```
```{r}
library(Lahman)
```

# To convert to a tibble so it prints nicely
```{r}
batting <- as_tibble(Lahman::Batting)

  summarise(
    avg_delay1 = mean(arr_delay),
    avg_delay2 = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]) 
  )
```
# To find why the distance to some destinations are more variable than to others
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance_sd))
```
# To find when the first and last flights leave each day
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%

    first = min(dep_time),
    last = max(dep_time)
